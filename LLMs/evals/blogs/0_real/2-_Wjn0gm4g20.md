### **My Search for Mentorship**

You can either learn from your experience or the experiences of others. The
former is slow and painful, while the latter is (relatively) quick and easy.
This is why having mentors can help accelerate progress toward your goals.

While this all sounds great in principle, **actually finding the right mentors
is much easier said than done**.  
  
This was something I struggled with for months. It felt like my interests were
too niche. I was (and still am) interested in the intersection of data science
and entrepreneurship. While I found many data scientists and entrepreneurs out
there, it was difficult to connect with those that identify with both
categories.

However, after months of futile cold messages on LinkedIn, there came a
turning point when I decided to transition my search **off of LinkedIn and
onto Upwork**.

### **Entrepreneurs are on Upwork**

For those unfamiliar, Upwork is a freelancing platform where clients post
jobs, and freelancers apply for these jobs. I first interacted with Upwork as
a [freelancer back in grad school](https://medium.com/the-data-entrepreneurs/how-to-start-freelancing-in-data-science-150551f25fda). However,
I came in as a client in this most recent interaction.

As a client on Upwork, you can browse and book time with freelancers. As I
explored the talent, I quickly realized there are _serious data scientists_ on
Upwork.

I’m talking about decades of experience and 6–7F revenues on the platform (and
that’s just on Upwork). But the real kicker is any data scientist on Upwork
is, by default, an entrepreneur (or at least closer to one than what you’ll
typically find on LinkedIn). So it seemed I had found my niche mentors.

This kicked off a series of **10 calls with top data scientists** on Upwork. I
structured the calls in 3 parts: Past — how did you get started?, Present —
how do you operate now?, and Future — where is this going?

I follow the same structure in this article to summarize and highlight key
takeaways from these conversations. I hope this gives you some context and
inspiration for what your data entrepreneurship journey can look like.

### **What got you into Data Science?**

One of the most striking observations from these calls is that no two data
science freelancer journeys were the same. Just to give a sense of this, here
are the educational backgrounds of the 10 freelancers I spoke with _Biomedical
Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Biostatistics, Electrical Engineering,
Computer Science, Finance, Physics, Data Science, Marketing, AI, Economics,
Math, MBA, and DS Bootcamp_.

Notice there are more backgrounds here than interviews, this is for two
reasons.

  1. Most had training beyond a bachelor’s degree, and
  2. No 2 out of the 10 freelancers had the same exact training

The latter point is one of my favorite aspects of data science. It is a field
that draws a wide range of perspectives and experiences, which makes for very
interesting conversation and collaboration.

This is important to keep in mind when reading this article. The diversity in
backgrounds extends to how freelancers operate and where they are headed. Put
simply, **_different is the norm here_.**

### **How did you start freelancing?**

While each freelancer’s start was unique, there was a common starting strategy
that came up a few times. In the early days, many freelancers tended to have a
**strong focus on learning and reputation building**.

There is more to data science freelancing than just the “hands-on-keyboard”
work. Not only do you need to do data science, but you also need to sell
yourself, juggle clients, manage your financials, etc.

A common way freelancers navigated this was to take on a (relatively) high
volume of small projects in the early days. Not only does this provide several
repetitions to learn from, but having a long list of successfully completed
projects (with testimonials) creates credibility and makes it easier to get
new clients.

While this “small-and-wide” strategy was great for getting started, it did not
seem to be a common (or good) long-term strategy.

### **How do you operate now?**

In keeping with the “ _different is the norm_ ” theme, there was a wide mix of
how these freelancers currently worked and got paid. Here are a few examples
to give you an idea of this.

  * Freelancing full-time
  * Freelancing part-time while pursuing a side venture
  * Working full-time role while freelancing on the side
  * Full-time contract role (1099)
  * Transitioning out of freelance into a full-time role (W2)

This highlights the flexibility of freelancing. It allows professionals to
tailor their work to what works best for them.

For those who were not seeking full-time work, it was common to limit the
weekly time commitment for each client. 10 hr/week per client seemed to be a
sweet spot, with a typical variation between 5–20 hr/week. With this time
allotment, freelancers would typically have 2–3 clients at a time.

### **How do you get new clients?**

There were **3 common ways the freelancers got new clients**. The **first**
and most common way was applying for contracts on Upwork or other sites.

The **second** way was via inbound leads (i.e. clients found them) on Upwork
or other platforms. This occurred most often for those with a great
reputation, a list of testimonials, or a strong presence on social media.

Finally, the **third** way (which was common for the most successful
freelancers) was getting work from referrals alone. This seemed to happen when
there was much more demand from clients than the freelance could supply (which
also naturally drove up prices.)

### **Where is this going?**

Each freelancer had a unique vision for their future. However, to make this
more digestible, here I partition the long-term goals into 3 buckets.

#### **Keep Freelancing & Scale Up Consulting Business**

The first bucket includes the ones that can see themselves **freelancing
forever**. They enjoy it, and it gives them a nice life. They work when they
want, on what they want, with who they want, and where they want.

Also, in this bucket, I put the ones who want to **scale up their consulting
business**. This tends to happen organically for those who have too much work
than they can do alone and who enjoy project management. For many, this is as
simple as having subcontractors that they work with frequently or even full-
time employees.

#### **Generate Passive Income & Build a Product-Oriented Company**

Although freelancing provides tremendous freedom and can be lucrative, it
still mainly consists of trading time for money _e.g. I pay you an hourly rate
to do a job_. While this isn’t so bad, most would rather trade a little time
for a lot of money _e.g. you build a product once and sell it many times_.

This is the second long-term goal bucket which lumps together generating
passive income with building a product-oriented business. While these are
technically different, they both can serve the same purpose: **generating more
value in less time**.

Some freelancers planned to do this by creating online courses or other
digital products. A handful of freelancers were actively building trading bots
or other trading tools for personal use.

Others considered building software solutions tailored to mid-size companies
or specific industries by leveraging their freelance experience and clientele.
While I haven’t yet personally seen a successful realization of this latter
idea, I am optimistic about it.

#### **Transition to a Full-time Role**

While freelancing offers flexibility and independence, some freelancers may
eventually transition into full-time roles. Some even consistently cycle in
and out of full-time roles. A few reasons for this from those that I
interviewed were: you can make a bigger impact at an enterprise, more social
interaction and collaboration, more certainty and income stability, greater
opportunities for career growth, and a client becomes an employer.

### **My 4 Takeaways**

These calls fulfilled the promise of mentorship that I was seeking in that
they helped accelerate progress toward my goals. While it’s hard to say how
things will turn out, I have a feeling this may be **one of the best
investments I made in my entrepreneurship journey**. I’m looking forward to
putting these learnings into practice and continuing to build relationships
with others in this space.

To wrap things up, here are the **4 key takeaways** that I will keep top of
mind for future freelancing endeavors.

  1. **Do good work so you can operate on reputation and referrals**. If people come to you, you have greater leverage and optionality to help ensure the work and clients you take on are aligned with your goals.
  2. **Find a niche**. Choosing a niche can help make you a big fish in a small pond. Here are some niches that came up in my interviews: finance, crypto, energy, OCR, LLM applications, and data strategy.
  3. **Form alliances across the tech stack**. Data science work alone can be limited in its business impact and value generation. This is why forming relationships with other specialists (e.g. SWE, web dev, UX/UI, etc.) can help you provide greater value to your clients.
  4. **Develop a personal brand**. Having a strong brand presence on social media platforms can make it easier to land freelance contracts by giving you credibility. Additionally, sharing valuable content and showcasing your expertise can help ideal clients find you (as opposed to you having to find them).
